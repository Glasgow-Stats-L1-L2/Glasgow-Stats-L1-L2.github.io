The population correlation is a measure of the magnitude of the strength of the relationship between two random variables X and Y, and is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho(X,Y) = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}}, \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] and can be estimated by replacing each of \\(\\text{Cov}(X,Y)\\), (X) and (Y) by their unbiased estimators to give \\[\\begin{equation} r = \\frac{S_{xy}}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}S_{yy}}}=\\frac{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\\overline{x})(y_i-\\overline{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(x_i-\\overline{x})^2(y_i-\\overline{y})^2}}, \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] the sample correlation coefficient (-1 \\(\\le r \\le\\) 1). Given a sample of data, we can assess the statistical significance of the observed correlations between variables in the wider population. To do this we perform a hypothesis test (more on this in Chapter 2.2). "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
