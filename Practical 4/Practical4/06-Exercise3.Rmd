# Exercise 3 - Transformation of the response and predicator

At times it will be necessary to transform both the response and the predictor. Using the `SIMDATAST` data set produce an ouput of your graphs in a 2 rows x 3 columns grid:
<br> (a) i. Plot $y_1$ against $x_3$

(ii) Define the model for $y_1$ against $x_3$ and create the residual vs fitted values plot.

(iii)	Log transform the response variable and produce a new scatterplot.

(iv) Define the model for $log(y_1)$ against $x_3$ and create a residual vs fitted values plot.

(v) Square-root predictor and plot a scatterplot of $log(y_1)$ against $\sqrt{x_3}$

(vi)	Define the model for $log(y_1)$ against $\sqrt{x_3}$ and create a residual vs fitted values plot.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE, webex.hide="Solution code"}

# create 2 rows x 3 columns grid
par(mfrow = c(2, 3)) 

# plot y vs x3
plot(y1 ~ x3, data = SIMDATAST,main="Scatterplot of y1~x3") 
# define model for log transformed response y1 vs x3
mod1 <- lm(y1 ~ x3, data = SIMDATAST)
# you can choose to add the model line to the plot with abline(mod1)
# residual plot for mod1
plot(mod1, which = 1, main = "Residuals vs Fitted value for y1~x3")

# plot of log transformed y against x3
plot(log(y1) ~ x3, data = SIMDATAST, main = "Scatterplot of log(y1)~x3")
# define model for log transformed response y1 vs x3
mod2 <- lm(log(y1) ~ x3, data = SIMDATAST)
# optionally add abline(mod2) to the plot
# residual plot for mod2
plot(rstandard(mod2) ~ fitted(mod2), main="Residuals vs Fitted value for log(y1)~x3")
# optional to add abline(h=0,lty=3) to the plot

# plot of log transformed y against sqrt(x3)
plot(log(y1) ~ I(x3^0.5), data = SIMDATAST, main = "Scatterplot of log(y1)~sqrt(x3)")
mod3 <- lm(log(y1) ~ I(x3^.5), data = SIMDATAST) # define model for log transformed response y1 vs sqrt(x3)
#optional to add abline(mod3) to the plot
# residual plot for mod3
plot(rstandard(mod3) ~ fitted(mod3), main="Residuals vs fitted of log(y1)~sqrt(x3)")
# optional to add abline(h=0,lty=3) to the plot
